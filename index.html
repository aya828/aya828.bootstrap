                    I was born in New Jersey and raised both in NJ and Tokyo, Japan. I studied Journalism for undergrad
                    at Brooklyn College and earned a Bachelor’s degree. I then started working retail at Apple then
                    transitioned into technical support at Apple, where my interest grew for technology. I knew I wanted
                    to pursue a career in technology and started on my Master’s degree at Marymount University for
                    Cybersecurity and moved to Alexandria, VA.

                    While attending school, I became a Systems Administrator and soon found that a Systems Administrator
                    was not something I wanted to be. I found the GWU Coding Bootcamp online and decided to take this
                    step towards becoming a web developer!
